Consciousness is a kind of emergent property. 
Human's consciousness is an emergent property in a chaotic system composed of tens of billions of neurons connected through hundreds of billions of connections.
If we could reproduce this emergent property in similarly complex systems, such as quantum computers, artificial consciousness might be achievable.
This would explain where our subjective experience comes from.
